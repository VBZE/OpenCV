On Line 4 we manipulate the top lief pixel in the in.
age which as located at coordinate 4080 and setat to hal
a value of (, 0, 26565 df we were reading this peel valun
in RGB format, we would have a value of 6 for red. 5 fot

green, and 255 tor blue, thus making it a pure blue color

However, as I mentioned above, we need to take speciai
care when working with Open NV. Our preels are as malls
stored in BGR tormat. not RGB format

We actually read this pixel as 255 tor red, 6 tor green, and

G tor blue, making, it a red color, not a blue color

After setting, the top-left pixel to have a red color on Line
14, we then grab the pixel value and print ait back to con
sole on Lines 15 and 16, just to demonstrate that we have
indeed successfully changed the color of the pixel

Accessing and setting a single pixel values simple enough.
but what if we wanted to use NumPy's array sheing capa-
bilities to access larger rectangular portions of the image?

The code below demonstrates how we can do this

 
  

- corner + image (0. 106,

s ev2 asubow! .

 

On line 17 we grab a 100 < 100 pixel region of the image
In fact, this is the top-left corner of the image! In order to
grab chunks of an image, NumbPv expects we provide four
